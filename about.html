	<p>Pete is Cotto’s founder. His love of cooking comes from a childhood of good food and perhaps his distant Ital
	roots. His mother used to be a private cook to some of London’s leading boardrooms. While growing up, Pete and 
siblings were always encouraged by both parents to get involved in the kitchen.<br/><br/>
	In his final year at school Pete took a cookery class with the same teacher who inspired food writer, Tom Parker Bowl
	Immediately after his A Levels, Pete went to southern Ireland to train at Ballymaloe Cookery School.</p>

	<p>He was taught there by Darina Allen and her daughter-in-law, Rachel. It was then straight on to the French Alps
	spend a ski season cooking for ten demanding guests in a chalet at the tender age of eighteen.<br/><br/>
	Pete completed a degree at Bristol University in one of his other great interests, politics. With his culinary skills
	was quite a popular housemate - no Pot Noodles or cans of baked beans in his student houses! He now lives in south w
London running Cotto.</p>
